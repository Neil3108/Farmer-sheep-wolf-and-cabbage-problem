# Farmer-sheep-wolf-and-cabbage-problem
This program solves the famous farmer, sheep, wolf and cabbage problem. The farmer wants to cross the river from the east shore to the west shore, but his boat is small. The boat has space for only the farmer with one of the items: cabbage, wolf, or goat. The farmer cannot leave the wolf alone with the goat or the goat alone with the cabbage.
